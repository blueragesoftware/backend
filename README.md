# Bluerage Backend

A mobile-first execution environment for AI agents. It's a platform designed for rapid small automation ideas, see what works, and iterate quickly.

## Core Features

**Agent Creation**
Build AI agents by connecting your existing applications and assembling workflows. Anyone can create agents without coding - just describe your goal and define the steps.

**Automated Execution**
Agents run automatically based on schedules or triggers. Share content with agents from our iOS app and trigger workflows on-the-go.

**Tool Integration**
Connect agents to your existing tools: Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, Notion, and more. Agents work with the applications you already use.
